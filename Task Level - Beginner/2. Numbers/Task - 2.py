'''
 In a village, there is a circular pond with a radius of 84 meters.
 Calculate the area of the pond using the formula: Circle Area = π
 r^2. (Use the value 3.14 for π) Bonus Question: If there is exactly
 1.4 liters of water in a square meter, what is the total amount of
 water in the pond? Print the answer without any decimal point in
 it. Hint: Circle Area = π r^2 Water in the pond = Pond Area
 Water per Square Meter
'''

pi = 3.14
radius = 84
area = pi * (radius ** 2)
